            <h3>Are ERC loans typically secured? <span>+</span></h3>
            <p>
              Yes, ERC loans are secured against employers’ anticipated ERC
              refund amount. Personal guarantees may also apply depending on the
              viability of employers’ businesses, creditworthiness, and other
              factors.

              How long does receiving funds for an ERC Buyout take, and is it
              faster than an ERC loan? <span>+</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              Pre-approvals can take as little as 24 hours, but the time it
              takes to receive funds for an ERC Buyout or an ERC loan is closer
              to one to two weeks. ERC Buyouts can be faster. Turnarounds are
              primarily determined by applicants’ responsiveness to requests for
              documentation or information and lenders’ capabilities.

              Lenders’ requirements for ERC Advance Loans and ERC Buyouts vary

            <ul>
              <li>Satisfy the IRS’s ERC Eligibility Criteria</li>
              <li>Proof of IRS Form 941-X Report Submission(s)</li>

              <li>
                Minimum Credit Score of 500 (ERC Buyout) or 600 (ERC Advance

            </h3>
            <p>
              The IRS will include accrued interest when issuing employers’ ERC
              refunds based on the dates the refund amount applies and their
              processing time. This IRS-paid interest accounts for the time
              value of outstanding ERC balances with the agency.
